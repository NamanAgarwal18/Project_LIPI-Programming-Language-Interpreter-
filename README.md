# Lipi Programming Language

## Description
**Lipi** is a small programming language created by Naman Agarwal. It supports various fundamental programming concepts such as variable-declaration, function calling, conditional statements, loops, proper order of operations, and recursion. Along with the language there is a **Python** based interpreter to run the code written in Lipi. The execution of a program in Lipi starts with the main function which does not return anything.

## Language Grammar
### 1. Variable Declaration:
* All variables start with a ```$``` symbol. For example:
  ```
  name = 20
  ```
